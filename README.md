# XmlEditor
A generic XML reader and editor

## How to use

- Create a new XML file or open and existing one with the menu options.
- Clicking on the _New_ button on the TreeView toolbar will add a new XElement to the root or the selected XML node
- Selecting a node will display all its information on the right hand side, where its name, value and attributes can be edited
- You cannot edit the value of an XElement that has children.

## Roadmap

- Delete XElements (nodes)
- Delete XAttributes
