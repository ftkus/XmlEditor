# XmlEditor
A generic XML reader and editor

## How to use

- Create a new XML file or open an existing one with the menu options.
- Clicking on the _New_ button on the TreeView toolbar will add a new XElement to the root or the selected XElement node
- Selecting a node will display all its information on the right hand side, where its name, value and attributes can be edited
- You cannot edit the value of an XElement that has children.

## Roadmap

- ~~Delete XElements (nodes)~~
- Delete XAttributes
- Limit XElement creation to a single XElement at the root level (and then default to the first-level)
